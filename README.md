# Canadian-Baseball-League-Park-Factors

The Canadian Baseball League (CBL), formerly the Intercounty Baseball League, stands as Canada’s premier all-Canadian professional baseball circuit, featuring nine teams — from the Welland Jackfish to the Toronto Maple Leafs (the baseball ones) — all within a 4.5-hour drive of one another. What makes the league truly special is its blend of everyday “working men” who train after their day jobs, former MLB All-Stars like Fernando Rodney and Ángel Castro, and a deep roster of ex-minor leaguers and international talent, all competing on the same field. Players double as teachers, train conductors, telecom reps, and even city council candidates by day, then become small-town heroes under the lights at night. With only eight import spots allowed per team, the league showcases elite Canadian talent at minor-league caliber for just $10–$15 a ticket. Adding to the charm are wildly different ballparks: big-league beauties like Labatt Park, bandboxes like Dominico Field, and wind-swept quirks like Bernie Arbour and Jack Couch Ball Park — where one chilly night might produce a 3–0 pitcher’s duel and the next a 21–19 football score. It’s a one-of-a-kind North American pro league where everyday Canadians share the diamond with big-league veterans, and the ballparks themselves are as much characters as the players.

I created the CBL Park Factors because I was curious to see how each ballpark created a run scoring environment. The entire project can be found here!
